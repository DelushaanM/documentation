<Note>
Note: You must have npm version 5.5.1 or higher to use access tokens.

</Note>
Access tokens provide an alternative to using your username and password for authenticating to npm, whether you're working with the API or the npm command-line interface (CLI). These tokens are hexadecimal strings that let you install or publish modules securely.

There are two types of access tokens:

Legacy Tokens
Granular Access Tokens
You can create access tokens to allow tools like continuous integration (CI) systems to access your npm packages. For example, you can store tokens as secrets in GitHub Actions to authenticate workflows. This enables npm tasks, such as installing private packages, to be completed automatically.

Tokens can be managed either through the web interface or the CLI. Changes made in one environment will reflect in the other.

The npm token commands allow you to:

View and manage existing tokens
Create new legacy tokens
Restrict access by IP address ranges (CIDR)
Revoke or delete tokens
For detailed instructions on creating and managing tokens, see "[Creating and viewing access tokens][create-token]".

Legacy Tokens
Legacy tokens grant the same permissions as the user who created them. When you log in via npm login, a publish token is generated automatically.

There are three types of legacy tokens:

Read-only: Used to download packages. Ideal for automation workflows that involve package installation. For better security, use granular access tokens.

Automation: Used for downloading and publishing packages. Best for CI/CD workflows. Automation tokens bypass 2FA for operations on npm. For enhanced security, we recommend switching to granular access tokens.

Publish: Grants full controlâ€”downloading, installing packages, and updating settings. These tokens are suited for interactive workflows, such as working through the CLI. If your account has 2FA enabled, 2FA will be required for sensitive actions using these tokens.

Legacy tokens don't expire, so keeping them secure is critical. For more tips, see "[Securing your token][secure-token]."

Granular Access Tokens
Granular access tokens offer more control by allowing you to define specific permissions for the token. With these tokens, you can:

Limit access to specific packages or scopes
Grant access to specific organizations
Set an expiration date for the token
Restrict access by IP address ranges
Choose between read-only or read and write access
You can create up to 1,000 granular tokens on your npm account, and each can last a minimum of one day. A single token can be used to access up to 50 organizations or a combination of 50 packages and scopes. Granular tokens inherit the user's permissions, meaning the token can't exceed the permissions granted to its owner. If the user loses access to a package or organization, the associated token's access will also be revoked.

When a token is assigned to an organization, it can only manage the organization's settings, teams, and users. It doesn't grant permission to publish packages for the organization.
